I am a final-year Bachelor's student majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science at [Chennai Mathematical Institute](https://www.cmi.ac.in/). My current interests primarily include Mathematical Finance, Stochastic Calculus and Statistics. 

I have worked on various projects including options pricing using stochastic calculus (including the Black-Scholes and Heston models), implied volatility pair trading strategies with z-score and Kalman filters, all with realistic trading constraints like time-to-expiry adjustments, holding periods, and market making. I am reading more on Portfolio Optimization, Risk Analysis and Signature based volatility modelling for exotic derivative pricing.

I am currently a Quantitative Research intern at [alphatensor.ai](https://www.alphatensor.ai/) where my goal is to generate alphas using ANNs of various architectures.
